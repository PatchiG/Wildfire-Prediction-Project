# Wildfire Activities in Australia
This project aims to analyze and visualize wildfire activities in Australia using a dataset spanning from 2005. By exploring patterns and trends within the data, we seek to gain insights into the behaviour of wildfires across different regions of Australia. Wildfire Analysis and Visualization in Australia.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to utilize the provided dataset to:

1. Analyze patterns and trends in wildfire activities in Australia.
2. Create visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and Folium to represent the data effectively.
3. Gain insights into the behavior of wildfires in various regions of Australia.

## Datasets
The dataset contains information on fire activities in Australia starting from 2005. It includes data points such as the location of wildfires, their intensity, duration, and other relevant attributes.

## Tools & Libraries

This project utilizes the following tools and libraries:

1. Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
2. Seaborn: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
3. Pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python.

## Project Outline

The project is structured as follows:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to identify patterns and trends.
3. Visualization: Creating visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium to represent the findings effectively.
4. Model Building: Built prediction models like Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor.
